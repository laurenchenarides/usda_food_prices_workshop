## Activity: Using the Dashboard

<font size="8">**Time: 15 minutes**</font>

**Objective:** You will use the dashboard to find information about the dataset assigned to your breakout group (see table below). You will be asked a series of questions that are aimed to find specific data usage statistics for your assigned dataset.

| Breakout Group   | Assigned Dataset | 
|--------|----------------|
| Group 1  |   Census of Agriculture      | 
| Group 2  |   FoodAPS      | 
| Group 3  |   Current Population Survey -- Food Security Supplement      | 
| Group 4  |   Food Access Research Atlas      | 

### Tasks

**UPDATE SCENARIOS TO MATCH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SITE**
**USE CONSISTENT PHRASING TO HAVE THEM ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE WE KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWERS**

Answer: 

6. But, what if I want to target an Ag Econ journal?

7. If time allows, clear your filter and pick a new dataset. 


## Reflection Questions
