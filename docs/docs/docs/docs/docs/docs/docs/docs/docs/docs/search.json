The structure of the breakout room is as follows:\r\nActivity\r\nTime Allotted\r\nIntroductions\r\n5 minutes\r\nActivity #1\r\n15 minutes\r\nActivity #2\r\n22 minutes\r\nReflection Questions\r\n8 minutes\r\nIntroductions\r\nTotal Time: 5 minutes\r\nWelcome, everyone! Let’s start off with a quick icebreaker.\r\nPlease introduce yourself by sharing:\r\nYour name.\r\nThe institution or organization you’re affiliated with.\r\nThink of a paper you’re currently working on. Share the dataset you’re using and how you’re accessing it.\r\nActivity #1\r\nTotal Time: 15 minutes\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right dataset for your research project.\r\nWe recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like the one being featured today (DemocratizingData.ai), are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.\r\nThis first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding these statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work.\r\nThought Experiment\r\nTo conceptualize this ideal tool, we will go through a role-playing scenario.\r\nScenario: Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.\r\nObjective: We will walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining the usefulness of this dataset to you.\r\nInstructions: For answering the questions, we’ll use Idea Boards, an online collaboration tool that allows participants to share their thoughts and insights through sticky notes.\r\nShort tutorial on how to use an Idea Board.\r\nWhen instructed, please navigate to your group’s Idea Board:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nLink to Idea Board\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nIdea Board 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\nIdea Board 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nIdea Board 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nIdea Board 4\r\nA short guide on how to use Idea Boards:\r\nNavigate to the provided link to access our group’s Idea Board.\r\nOnce there, you’ll find different columns, each corresponding to a specific question or part of our discussion.\r\nTo add your input, click on the ‘Add Sticky’ button (the green plus sign) in the column where you want to post your sticky note.\r\nYou will see a new sticky note appear - start typing your comment.\r\nFeel free to move your notes around, edit them as the discussion evolves, or “up vote” sticky notes written by others in your group.\r\nQuestions\r\nScenario: Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.\r\nWhat key pieces of information would you want to know about the usage of this dataset?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Pieces of Information” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nAre there tools / resources that can provide you with the information you want?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Tools / Resources” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nWhat features does, or should, a tool / resource have to help you decide if the dataset is useful?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Features” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nQuick Poll\r\n\r\nLoading…\r\n\r\nLink to poll\r\nActivity #2\r\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\r\nFor the next activity, we will walk you through a prototype dashboard that provides data usage information about USDA datasets. (Access the dashboard here.)\r\nThe primary functions of the dashboard include:\r\nIdentifying users of USDA-produced datasets by region, institution, and field\r\nProviding information on publications and citations featuring USDA-produced datasets\r\nDashboard Walkthrough\r\nTime: 7 minutes\r\nLet’s walk through the dashboard using an example dataset: Farm to School Census. This will help everyone familiarize themselves with the dashboard and the types of questions we will be exploring. Please note that there are many features of this dashboard, so the purpose of this tutorial is to give you a framework of how to use the tool. You will have the opportunity to explore this dashboard in greater depth on your own.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above walks through the current version of the Democratizing Data dashboard.\r\nQuestions\r\nTask\r\nTask Description\r\nAnswer\r\n1\r\nLocate your dataset: Navigate to where you can filter USDA-produced datasets.\r\nSelect “Farm to School Census” for this tutorial\r\n2\r\nIdentify an expert: Who can we ask for help?\r\nBecca Jablonski\r\n3\r\nIdentify five papers: What papers can we read that have used this dataset?\r\nBig Hunger\r\n4\r\nExplore publications by citation count: What journal has the most publications using this dataset?\r\nJournal of Hunger and Environmental Nutrition\r\n5\r\nExplore publications by specific sub-field: What journals in Ag Econ have published manuscripts using this dataset?\r\nGo to “All Science Journal Classification Subfields”, select “Economics and Econometrics”\r\nDemocratizing Data User Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above provides additional information developed by the Democratizing Data team. Link to guide\r\nOn Your Own\r\nTime: 15 minutes\r\nOverview: Now you will explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard on your own. This activity is designed to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how you can use it to collect data usage statistics.\r\nObjective: To assess the relevance and usefulness of the statistics provided by the prototype dashboard, and to evaluate how effectively the dashboard meets the needs of a research-oriented user community, focusing specifically on the statistics collected and displayed.\r\nGroup Assignments: Each group will focus on a different dataset. Answer the same set of questions as we have practiced with the Farm to School Census. Please navigate the dashboard on your own. The datasets for each group are as follows:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nAssigned Dataset\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nCensus of Agriculture\r\nGroup 2\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\nFoodAPS\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nCurrent Population Survey – Food Security Supplement\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nFood Access Research Atlas\r\n\r\n>>>Link to Dashboard<<<\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\nRespond to the series of questions to uncover detailed data usage statistics.

The USDA and their partners are developing a dashboard to track who and how USDA-produced datasets are used by the public, an initiative inspired by the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018. The purpose of this workshop is to collect feedback from prospective users of the dashboard, and to use these comments to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve the needs of the research community.\r\nAcknowledgement\r\nThis workshop is supported by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS). We would like to thank the following individuals:\r\nJulia Lane (New York University)\r\nNancy Potok (Former Chief Statistician of the United States)\r\nSpiro Stefanou (USDA ERS)\r\nKelly Maguire (USDA ERS)\r\nJoe Parsons (USDA NASS)\r\nHubert Hamer (USDA NASS)\r\nNick Pallotta (USDA NASS)\r\nTina Zdawczyk (Elsevier)\r\nWe welcome them to the workshop!\r\nA Special Welcome from Julia Lane and Joe Parsons\r\nTime: 3 minutes \r\n\r\nJulia Lane           Joe Parsons    \r\nWhy Your Participation Matters\r\nResearch Value: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.\r\nNetworking and Knowledge Sharing Value: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.\r\nCommunity Impact: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.\r\nWorkshop Details\r\nTeam Introductions\r\nTime: 3 minutes Led by: Allie Bauman\r\nThe workshop is being led by a team from Colorado State University:\r\n\r\n\r\nAllie Bauman\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke Fitzgerald\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\n\r\n\r\nTaís de Menezes\r\n\r\n\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\n\r\n\r\nMackenzie Gill\r\n\r\n\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\n\r\n\r\nSione Ikeme\r\n\r\n\r\nMayla Boguslav\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop Etiquette\r\nTime: 1 minute Led by: Rebecca Cleary\r\nTo ensure a smooth and productive workshop experience for everyone, please follow these Zoom etiquette guidelines:\r\nKeep video on when possible (particularly in the breakout rooms). Keeping your video on helps maintain engagement and create a more interactive environment.\r\nUse the “Raise Hand” feature to ask questions or make comments. The discussant will call on you when it’s your turn.\r\nBe on mute unless you’re speaking. This helps reduce background noise and ensure that the speaker is heard clearly.\r\nPlease respect the contributions of others and avoid interrupting when someone else is speaking.\r\nIf you have questions or need further explanation, please use the chat feature to ask for clarification.\r\nBreakout Groups\r\nTime: 1 minute Led by: Rebecca Cleary\r\nThe majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups. You will be assigned to one of four breakout groups. Assignments are based on your research area or sub-discipline specialty. Participants will take part in two activities within their breakout rooms. All participants will reconvene to share their experience toward the end of the workshop. The workshop moderator will keep track of time and inform breakout groups how much time remains within the breakout rooms.\r\nEach breakout group will have a discussant and a note taker, assigned below:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nNote Taker\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nBrooke Fitzgerald\r\nGroup 2\r\nBecky Cleary\r\nTaís de Menezes\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nMackenzie Gill\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nSione Ikeme\r\nModerator\r\nMayla Boguslav\r\n\r\nWe value your perspective in shaping the development of this tool.
