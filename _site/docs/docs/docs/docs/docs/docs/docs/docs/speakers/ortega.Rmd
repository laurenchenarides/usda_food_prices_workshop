**Presentation Title:** Shocks, Supply Chain Disruptions and Food Prices

**Abstract:** From 2021 to 2022, U.S. consumers experienced the largest annual increase in food prices in 40 years, posing significant challenges, particularly for low-income households. This keynote address delves into the multifaceted factors behind this surge, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, climate change, and animal diseases. It will also examine how these issues have disrupted the food supply chain and impacted consumer spending. The presentation will highlight the complexity of isolating individual effects on retail food prices and discuss the overall impact of food price inflation on consumers. Researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders will gain valuable insights to enhance discussions on food price inflation, improve forecasting, and develop strategies to strengthen the resilience of the food supply chain amid ongoing global challenges.
