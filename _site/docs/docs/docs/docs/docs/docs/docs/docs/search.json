The structure of the breakout room is as follows:\r\nActivity\r\nTime Allotted\r\nIntroductions\r\n5 minutes\r\nActivity #1\r\n15 minutes\r\nActivity #2\r\n22 minutes\r\nReflection Questions\r\n8 minutes\r\nIntroductions\r\nTotal Time: 5 minutes\r\nWelcome, everyone! Let’s start off with a quick icebreaker.\r\nPlease introduce yourself by sharing:\r\nYour name.\r\nThe institution or organization you’re affiliated with.\r\nThink of a paper you’re currently working on. Share the dataset you’re using and how you’re accessing it.\r\nActivity #1\r\nTotal Time: 15 minutes\r\nIn today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right dataset for your research project.\r\nWe recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like the one being featured today (DemocratizingData.ai), are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.\r\nThis first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding these statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work.\r\nThought Experiment\r\nTo conceptualize this ideal tool, we will go through a role-playing scenario.\r\nScenario: Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.\r\nObjective: We will walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining the usefulness of this dataset to you.\r\nInstructions: For answering the questions, we’ll use Idea Boards, an online collaboration tool that allows participants to share their thoughts and insights through sticky notes.\r\nShort tutorial on how to use an Idea Board.\r\nWhen instructed, please navigate to your group’s Idea Board:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nLink to Idea Board\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nIdea Board 1\r\nGroup 2\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\nIdea Board 2\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nIdea Board 3\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nIdea Board 4\r\nA short guide on how to use Idea Boards:\r\nNavigate to the provided link to access our group’s Idea Board.\r\nOnce there, you’ll find different columns, each corresponding to a specific question or part of our discussion.\r\nTo add your input, click on the ‘Add Sticky’ button (the green plus sign) in the column where you want to post your sticky note.\r\nYou will see a new sticky note appear - start typing your comment.\r\nFeel free to move your notes around, edit them as the discussion evolves, or “up vote” sticky notes written by others in your group.\r\nQuestions\r\nScenario: Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.\r\nWhat key pieces of information would you want to know about the usage of this dataset?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Pieces of Information” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nAre there tools / resources that can provide you with the information you want?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Tools / Resources” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nWhat features does, or should, a tool / resource have to help you decide if the dataset is useful?\r\nAdd your responses as sticky notes to the “Features” Idea Board.\r\nTime: 3 minutes\r\n\r\nQuick Poll\r\n\r\nLoading…\r\n\r\nLink to poll\r\nActivity #2\r\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\r\nFor the next activity, we will walk you through a prototype dashboard that provides data usage information about USDA datasets. (Access the dashboard here.)\r\nThe primary functions of the dashboard include:\r\nIdentifying users of USDA-produced datasets by region, institution, and field\r\nProviding information on publications and citations featuring USDA-produced datasets\r\nDashboard Walkthrough\r\nTime: 7 minutes\r\nLet’s walk through the dashboard using an example dataset: Farm to School Census. This will help everyone familiarize themselves with the dashboard and the types of questions we will be exploring. Please note that there are many features of this dashboard, so the purpose of this tutorial is to give you a framework of how to use the tool. You will have the opportunity to explore this dashboard in greater depth on your own.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above walks through the current version of the Democratizing Data dashboard.\r\nQuestions\r\nTask\r\nTask Description\r\nAnswer\r\n1\r\nLocate your dataset: Navigate to where you can filter USDA-produced datasets.\r\nSelect “Farm to School Census” for this tutorial\r\n2\r\nIdentify an expert: Who can we ask for help?\r\nBecca Jablonski\r\n3\r\nIdentify five papers: What papers can we read that have used this dataset?\r\nBig Hunger\r\n4\r\nExplore publications by citation count: What journal has the most publications using this dataset?\r\nJournal of Hunger and Environmental Nutrition\r\n5\r\nExplore publications by specific sub-field: What journals in Ag Econ have published manuscripts using this dataset?\r\nGo to “All Science Journal Classification Subfields”, select “Economics and Econometrics”\r\nDemocratizing Data User Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guide above provides additional information developed by the Democratizing Data team. Link to guide\r\nOn Your Own\r\nTime: 15 minutes\r\nOverview: Now you will explore the utility and functionality of the prototype dashboard on your own. This activity is designed to highlight different aspects of the dashboard and how you can use it to collect data usage statistics.\r\nObjective: To assess the relevance and usefulness of the statistics provided by the prototype dashboard, and to evaluate how effectively the dashboard meets the needs of a research-oriented user community, focusing specifically on the statistics collected and displayed.\r\nGroup Assignments: Each group will focus on a different dataset. Answer the same set of questions as we have practiced with the Farm to School Census. Please navigate the dashboard on your own. The datasets for each group are as follows:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nAssigned Dataset\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nCensus of Agriculture\r\nGroup 2\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\nFoodAPS\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nCurrent Population Survey – Food Security Supplement\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nFood Access Research Atlas\r\n\r\n>>>Link to Dashboard<<<\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\nRespond to the series of questions to uncover detailed data usage statistics. After completing the tasks, we will regroup to share insights and discuss your experiences.\r\nAs you navigate the dashboard to answer the questions, please make use of the chat feature in Zoom to provide comments, in real time, about your experience. Our note takers will be collecting your feedback.\r\nLocate your assigned dataset: Navigate to the location on the page where you can filter USDA-produced datasets.\r\nPrompt: As you filter through the datasets, please describe the ease or difficulty you encounter in locating your assigned dataset.

Even after recent\r\n            refinements, the current FPO approach to forecasting food\r\n            prices could be further improved by incorporating market\r\n            conditions such as energy costs, wages, labor availability,\r\n            transportation congestion, and market concentration, which\r\n            have recently been cited as drivers of record-breaking\r\n            inflation rates. Macroeconomic conditions that potentially\r\n            affect retail demand, including the money supply, exchange\r\n            rates, and core inflation, have only been examined in a\r\n            pre-pandemic context, and it is unclear whether these same\r\n            mechanisms can explain current inflationary trends. To\r\n            address these shortcomings and identify new research areas,\r\n            the workshop will gather top experts from government,\r\n            academia, and industry to identify stakeholders’ needs,\r\n            underutilized information, and the best methods for\r\n            evaluating and forecasting food prices.\r\n            Target Audience Experts from government,\r\n            academia, and industry in evaluating and forecasting food\r\n            prices.\r\n            Expected Outcomes The workshop’s main\r\n            goals are to present and discuss the research that has been\r\n            developed under the Strategic Priority Grant on the topic of\r\n            food prices and forecasting that was sponsored by the\r\n            USDA-ERS, foster the establishment of research partnerships\r\n            between attendees, and to gather papers for the publication\r\n            of a journal special issue.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Event Details\r\n            Wednesday, July 31, 2024, 8:00AM - 6:00PM\r\n            \r\n            Time\r\n            Session\r\n            8:00 AM - 8:30 AM\r\n            Registration and Coffee\r\n            8:30 AM - 8:40 AM\r\n            Introduction\r\n            8:40 AM - 9:10 AM\r\n            Keynote Speaker\r\n            9:10 AM - 9:40 AM\r\n            U.S. Inflation in the Context of International Price\r\n            Changes\r\n            9:40 AM - 10:10 AM\r\n            Policy Responses to Food Price Inflation\r\n            10:10 AM - 10:30 AM\r\n            Moderated Discussion/Q&A\r\n            10:30 AM - 10:45 AM\r\n            Break\r\n            10:45 AM - 11:45 AM\r\n            Retrospective Analysis on Food Price Inflation\r\n            11:45 AM - 1:00 PM\r\n            Lunch Break\r\n            1:00 PM - 2:15 PM\r\n            Methods for Evaluating and Forecasting Food Price\r\n            Changes\r\n            2:15 PM - 2:30 PM\r\n            Break\r\n            2:30 PM - 3:30 PM\r\n            Understanding Determinants of Food Prices for\r\n            Forecasting\r\n            3:30 PM - 3:45 PM\r\n            Break]\r\n            3:45 PM - 4:45 PM\r\n            Impacts of Food Price Changes\r\n            4:45 PM - 5:00 PM\r\n            Concluding Remarks\r\n            5:00 PM - 6:00 PM\r\n            Networking Reception\r\n            Thursday, August 1, 2024, 8:00AM - 12:30PM\r\n            \r\n            Time\r\n            Session\r\n            8:00 AM - 8:30 AM\r\n            Registration and Coffee\r\n            8:30 AM - 9:30 AM\r\n            Public Data Resources\r\n            9:30 AM - 9:45 AM\r\n            Break\r\n            9:45 AM - 10:45 AM\r\n            Private Data Collection and Research\r\n            10:45 AM - 12:00 PM\r\n            Breakout Sessions\r\n            12:00 PM - 12:30 PM\r\n            Closing Remarks\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Post-Workshop Survey\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            About\r\n            Us\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Additional\r\n            Resources\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            ##QR Code\r\n            For more information about how to participate in future\r\n            workshops, please email Dr. Lauren Chenarides at Lauren.Chenarides@colostate.edu.\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Workshop on Food Prices and Forecasting Sponsored by\r\nERS (PC52)\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      2024 AAEA Annual Meeting\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Food Price Outlook\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub Repo\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              About this Workshop\r\n              Description Increases in food price\r\n              inflation and volatility in recent years have renewed\r\n              focus on the determinants and impacts of food price\r\n              changes, as well as on the importance of reliable food\r\n              price forecasts. The USDA Food Price Outlook (FPO) tracks\r\n              and forecasts food price changes and FPO forecasts inform\r\n              USDA agencies, industry, academia, and the public and rank\r\n              second in web traffic among ERS data products. Even after\r\n              recent refinements, the current FPO approach to\r\n              forecasting food prices could be further improved by\r\n              incorporating market conditions such as energy costs,\r\n              wages, labor availability, transportation congestion, and\r\n              market concentration, which have recently been cited as\r\n              drivers of record-breaking inflation rates. Macroeconomic\r\n              conditions that potentially affect retail demand,\r\n              including the money supply, exchange rates, and core\r\n              inflation, have only been examined in a pre-pandemic\r\n              context, and it is unclear whether these same mechanisms\r\n              can explain current inflationary trends.

Many factors are likely responsible, including supply chain backups and increased production costs brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath, weaker global markets for wheat and fertilizers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the strong aggregate demand driven in part by historically-large U.S. government stimulus efforts. Using a newly-developed technique to identify the contributions supply and demand shocks make to food price inflation over time, we find that while about 77 percent of the observed food category-level food price changes from the early-1990s up to the pandemic period were due to supply shocks (with the demand side taking up the remaining 23 percent), recent inflation is characterized by demand shocks to a far greater degree—about twice as much as in the past. We show how decompositions like these, particularly when accomplished using food price data from local markets, can help target inflation-reducing interventions. In addition, we exploit the national price data to identify important contributors to inflation from both sides of the market.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nAna Aizcorbe\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Ana Aizcorbe is a research economist at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), where she conducts research into price index and other measurement issues.

Dr. Aizcorbe has a B.A. degree in economics from Georgetown University, and a Ph.D. in economics from Boston College.\r\nPresentation Title: Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index for Food Purchased for Off-Premises Consumption\r\nAbstract: This presentation will provide an introduction to the data sources and methods used to construct the price index that the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses to deflate personal consumption expenditures on the “Food purchased for off-premises consumption” in the national accounts.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nJulian Alston\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Julian Alston is a distinguished professor emeritus in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis, known for his work on the economics of agricultural and food policy. His recent projects have emphasized science & technology policy and the economics of agricultural innovation; food & nutrition policy, and the global challenges of poverty, malnutrition, and obesity; and wine economics. He has published numerous research articles, chapters, and books on these subjects—including The Effects of Farm and Food Policy on Obesity in the United States (2017) with Abigail Okrent.\r\nPresentation Title: The Incidence of Farm Commodity Price Increases on U.S. Food Consumers: Consequences for Healthy Diets, Obesity, and Consumer Welfare – A First Look\r\nAbstract: In this paper in process we extend the equilibrium displacement model developed by Okrent and Alston (2012) to allow for multiple cohorts of consumers, disaggregated according to their wealth status, and update the parameters using new data and revised estimation procedures. We use that model to examine the effects of exogenous changes in M farm commodity prices, and hence in retail prices of N food products, on per capita quantities demanded by each group of consumers. We translate those changes in per capita demanded of the various food products into measures of healthy eating (the Healthy Eating Index), obesity (BMI and its social cost), and consumer welfare (compensating variation). The exogenous changes in prices we consider are specified to represent both (1) recent past changes in U.S. farm commodity prices associated with specific causes, and (2) alternative scenarios for future global farm commodity markets reflecting alternative projections of climate change or projections of farm productivity growth, relative to a baseline for specific future years. An overview of the study and preliminary results will be presented at the workshop.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nJohn Baffes\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: John Baffes…\r\nPresentation Title: XXX\r\nAbstract: XXX\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nJude Bayham\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Jude Bayham…\r\nPresentation Title: XXX\r\nAbstract: XXX\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nAnne Byrne\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Anne Byrne is a research agricultural economist in the Food Markets Branch. Her research focuses on how consumers access and afford food. She analyzes economic features of the food landscape—including retail food markets, food banks, and other private food assistance services—and geographic variation of food availability. She also analyzes consumer food behavior, particularly among low income and resource limited households, including use of food assistance and substitution across products and outlets. Her work has been published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Food Policy, and Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, among other outlets.\r\nPresentation Title: Food Prices from the Consumer’s Point of View\r\nAbstract: This interactive presentation explores the customer experience of food prices. It looks at how customer experiences become translate into raw data and how raw data translates into overall measures of food prices. Using “food price artifacts” to build price change measures, we explore how staple product prices change, the emergence of new products and stores, geographic variation in prices, and issues of data quality.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nMetin Çakır\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Metin Çakır is a professor in the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota.

A large body of literature has emerged across several fields of economics. However, each study typically focuses on a single or subset of causes, indicating that factors contributing to the recent food price inflation are broadly ranging and complex. This paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of what we learned about the major causes of high food prices in 2020-2022 in the United States and how they differ from those identified in prior food price hikes during the Great Recession of 2008. To provide context, we first discuss stylized facts about the U.S. food industry structure and previous empirical evidence on economy-wide drivers of high food prices. We then survey the literature on drivers of food price surges observed since 2020. We document that price surges in 2020-2022 have some unique factors primarily stemming from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic—specifically, U.S. fiscal support and money supply growth are the leading causes. Like in 2008, high oil prices were not a major factor; while high commodity prices might have affected recent food price hikes, it was not found to be one of the primary factors as in 2008. Inflation expectations due to high oil prices, which played a significant role in 2008, were also not found to be an essential cause. Furthermore, the evidence on the role of factors directly related to retailers’ conduct, such as seller’s inflation or price gouging, is mixed. Considering our synthesis, we identify policy priorities and gaps where future research is needed.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Lauren Chenarides…\r\nPresentation Title: XXX\r\nAbstract: XXX\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nCatherine Cullinane-Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Catherine Cullinane-Thomas is an agricultural economist in the Diet, Safety, and Health Economics Branch in the Food Economics Division (FED) of the USDA Economic Research Service.

This data is available for free for academic use to researchers affiliated with US universities. Using this data, Numerator can track the US Census Bureau’s Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services report. Whereas the US Census report is top-down (based on surveying retailers about their revenues), Numerator’s analysis is bottom-up (based on receipts and purchase data from verified consumers). This difference allows Numerator to segment changes in retail sales by consumer demographics, looking at the behaviors of low, middle, and high-income consumers, by race/ethnicity, by generation/cohort, and by region of the country. This difference also allows Numerator to look within retailers to see what consumers are buying (e.g., essentials vs. discretionary purchases, brand name vs. private label items). This session will also cover additional topics that researchers may be interested in when using Numerator data, for example, tracking the purchases of SNAP/WIC recipients as SNAP/WIC benefits change and tracking how consumers adjust to food inflation.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nRaghav Goyal\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Dr. Raghav Goyal is an Assistant Professor at Louisiana State University (LSU).

Pandemic-related disruptions, avian influenza outbreaks, and the Russia-Ukraine war drove 2022 food-at-home inflation to its highest rate since 1974 (11.4%). In 2023, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) economists responded to these changes by updating food price forecasts with statistical learning protocols to select time-series models and prediction intervals to convey their uncertainty. We characterize the public good provided by these “adaptive” inflation forecasts and enhance them by continuously selecting exogenous variables, improving their precision and explanatory power. The all-items-less-food-and-energy (“core”) index helps predict food prices until 2017; then, the money supply, wholesale-food prices, and food service wages help generate optimal forecasts. The strong relationships between food prices and other prices and the money supply indicate the sensitivity of food markets to macroeconomic forces and government policy choices.\r\nPresentation Title: The landscape and challenges of nationally representative forecasting\r\nAbstract: The federal government provides many publicly available and internal forecasts and projections, which aid diverse stakeholders. The USDA - Economic Research Service economists contribute specialized expertise on future economic conditions along the food supply chain. These include the farm economy, production, storage, intermediate markets for agricultural inputs, trade and transportation, and retail food markets. The forecasted systems’ complexity and overlap with other USDA agency missions motivate interagency collaboration, notably with the Office of the Chief Economist. The diversity of objectives, available data, and audiences have historically encumbered standardization. However, advancements in statistical methods, operational practices, and computation resources provide opportunities for harmonization to the extent possible. This presentation introduces leaders from government, academia, and industry in identifying and implementing best practices to enhance the accuracy and informativeness of forecasts and projections.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nKaitlyn Malakoff\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Kaitlyn Malakoff is a PhD Student in the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University and a 2023 NMFS-Sea Grant Marine Resource Economics Fellow studying the effects of international trade policies on seafood supply chains in the United States.

We focus on the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) “fish and seafood” price forecast. Following USDA’s current practices, we use a time series seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) modeling approach with model selection to determine how seafood forecasts can be improved using more refined retail price series. We find substantial reductions in expected SARIMA forecast error of up to 51% and 31% as measured by mean absolute error when disaggregating by product form and species, respectively, suggesting that the aggregate “fish and seafood” forecast does not appropriately proxy for more refined product prices. We then allow for the inclusion of exogenous price determinants in a SARIMAX model framework and compare forecast performance to the SARIMA approach for different types of seafood. Preliminary results suggest that models that minimize information loss include exogenous price determinants, that the selected covariates differ by species and product form, and that a SARIMAX approach can reduce forecast error.\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nAparna Mathur\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Aparna Mathur…\r\nPresentation Title: XXX\r\nAbstract: XXX\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nSeth Meyer\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Seth Meyer…\r\nPresentation Title: XXX\r\nAbstract: XXX\r\n\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nMary Muth\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: Dr. Mary K.

F-MAP provides monthly food price data over time, across food groupings, and across geographic areas and includes monthly prices for 90 food-at-home (FAH) categories across 15 geographic areas of the United States. These data are constructed using retail scanner data, which offer extensive and detailed data on spatial and temporal food price variation but are collected from a nonprobability sample of retailers. To understand how prices reported by stores in the retail scanner data compare to established sources of retail price data, we benchmark the F-MAP to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for major food categories and regions. We find strong correlation between the CPI and the scanner data-based price index for all food at home across all geographies but find heterogeneity in the correlations across regions and food categories.\r\n\r\nBreakout Session Mediators\r\nhtmltools::HTML(’\r\n\r\nJames MacDonald\r\n\r\n\r\n’)\r\nBio: James M.

The USDA and their partners are developing a dashboard to track who and how USDA-produced datasets are used by the public, an initiative inspired by the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018. The purpose of this workshop is to collect feedback from prospective users of the dashboard, and to use these comments to refine and improve the dashboard to better serve the needs of the research community.\r\nAcknowledgement\r\nThis workshop is supported by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS). We would like to thank the following individuals:\r\nJulia Lane (New York University)\r\nNancy Potok (Former Chief Statistician of the United States)\r\nSpiro Stefanou (USDA ERS)\r\nKelly Maguire (USDA ERS)\r\nJoe Parsons (USDA NASS)\r\nHubert Hamer (USDA NASS)\r\nNick Pallotta (USDA NASS)\r\nTina Zdawczyk (Elsevier)\r\nWe welcome them to the workshop!\r\nA Special Welcome from Julia Lane and Joe Parsons\r\nTime: 3 minutes \r\n\r\nJulia Lane           Joe Parsons    \r\nWhy Your Participation Matters\r\nResearch Value: Your engagement is central to the development process. As a research-oriented agricultural economist, your insights and feedback will directly influence the development of this platform, ensuring it aligns with the actual needs of the community. Your contributions today will inform the platform’s future enhancements, making it more intuitive and valuable for researchers like you.\r\nNetworking and Knowledge Sharing Value: This workshop is designed to be interactive and discussion-based, bringing together research-active agricultural economists. It represents a unique opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and learn from your peers—some of whom you may already know and others you are yet to meet. We hope these interactions foster a sense of community and collaboration.\r\nCommunity Impact: The exclusivity of this workshop, limited to 40 agricultural economists, highlights the curated nature of this event. Your nomination to participate is a testament to the value we believe you bring to these discussions. Together, we have the potential to shape a tool that will serve not just our immediate needs but also set a benchmark for data discovery and application in policy oriented research.\r\nWorkshop Details\r\nTeam Introductions\r\nTime: 3 minutes Led by: Allie Bauman\r\nThe workshop is being led by a team from Colorado State University:\r\n\r\n\r\nAllie Bauman\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke Fitzgerald\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Cleary\r\n\r\n\r\nTaís de Menezes\r\n\r\n\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\n\r\n\r\nMackenzie Gill\r\n\r\n\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\n\r\n\r\nSione Ikeme\r\n\r\n\r\nMayla Boguslav\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop Etiquette\r\nTime: 1 minute Led by: Rebecca Cleary\r\nTo ensure a smooth and productive workshop experience for everyone, please follow these Zoom etiquette guidelines:\r\nKeep video on when possible (particularly in the breakout rooms). Keeping your video on helps maintain engagement and create a more interactive environment.\r\nUse the “Raise Hand” feature to ask questions or make comments. The discussant will call on you when it’s your turn.\r\nBe on mute unless you’re speaking. This helps reduce background noise and ensure that the speaker is heard clearly.\r\nPlease respect the contributions of others and avoid interrupting when someone else is speaking.\r\nIf you have questions or need further explanation, please use the chat feature to ask for clarification.\r\nBreakout Groups\r\nTime: 1 minute Led by: Rebecca Cleary\r\nThe majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups. You will be assigned to one of four breakout groups. Assignments are based on your research area or sub-discipline specialty. Participants will take part in two activities within their breakout rooms. All participants will reconvene to share their experience toward the end of the workshop. The workshop moderator will keep track of time and inform breakout groups how much time remains within the breakout rooms.\r\nEach breakout group will have a discussant and a note taker, assigned below:\r\nBreakout Group\r\nDiscussant\r\nNote Taker\r\nGroup 1\r\nAllie Bauman\r\nBrooke Fitzgerald\r\nGroup 2\r\nBecky Cleary\r\nTaís de Menezes\r\nGroup 3\r\nAlessandro Bonanno\r\nMackenzie Gill\r\nGroup 4\r\nLauren Chenarides\r\nSione Ikeme\r\nModerator\r\nMayla Boguslav\r\n\r\nWe value your perspective in shaping the development of this tool. We look forward to your active participation, insightful discussions, and feedback during this workshop.\r\nPlease hang tight, as you will now be moved into to your breakout rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Breakout Group Activities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
