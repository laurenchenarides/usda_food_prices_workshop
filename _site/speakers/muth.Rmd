**Presentation Title:** Sources and Analyses of Food Label Data from Proprietary Sources

**Abstract:** Store and household scanner data include product attributes at the barcode level that can be used to classify products for conducting analyses of food prices at a disaggregated level. For example, proprietary scanner data contain information on product attributes such as package type, whether the product is organic, and nutrient content. For some applications, additional or more specific product attributes from product labels may be desired and can be obtained from proprietary sources. The sources and content of proprietary label data and examples of analyses using the data will be presented.
