**Presentation Title:** Decomposing Food Price Inflation into Supply and Demand Shocks

**Abstract:** Recent food price inflation in the United States is comparable to historically sharp increases observed in the 1970s and early-1980s. Many factors are likely responsible, including supply chain backups and increased production costs brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath, weaker global markets for wheat and fertilizers following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the strong aggregate demand driven in part by historically-large U.S. government stimulus efforts. Using a newly-developed technique to identify the contributions supply and demand shocks make to food price inflation over time, we find that while about 77 percent of the observed food category-level food price changes from the early-1990s up to the pandemic period were due to supply shocks (with the demand side taking up the remaining 23 percent), recent inflation is characterized by demand shocks to a far greater degree—about twice as much as in the past. We show how decompositions like these, particularly when accomplished using food price data from local markets, can help target inflation-reducing interventions. In addition, we exploit the national price data to identify important contributors to inflation from both sides of the market.
