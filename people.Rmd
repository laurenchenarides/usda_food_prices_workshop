**Presentation Title:** Decomposing Food Price Inflation into Supply and Demand Shocks

**Abstract:** Recent food price inflation in the United States is comparable to historically sharp increases observed in the 1970s and early-1980s. Many factors are likely responsible, including supply chain backups and increased production costs brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath, weaker global markets for wheat and fertilizers following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the strong aggregate demand driven in part by historically-large U.S. government stimulus efforts. Using a newly-developed technique to identify the contributions supply and demand shocks make to food price inflation over time, we find that while about 77 percent of the observed food category-level food price changes from the early-1990s up to the pandemic period were due to supply shocks (with the demand side taking up the remaining 23 percent), recent inflation is characterized by demand shocks to a far greater degree—about twice as much as in the past. We show how decompositions like these, particularly when accomplished using food price data from local markets, can help target inflation-reducing interventions. In addition, we exploit the national price data to identify important contributors to inflation from both sides of the market.

He has published numerous research articles, chapters, and books on these subjects—including The Effects of Farm and Food Policy on Obesity in the United States (2017) with Abigail Okrent.  

**Presentation Title:** The Incidence of Farm Commodity Price Increases on U.S. Food Consumers: Consequences for Healthy Diets, Obesity, and Consumer Welfare – A First Look

**Abstract:** In this paper in process we extend the equilibrium displacement model developed by Okrent and Alston (2012) to allow for multiple cohorts of consumers, disaggregated according to their wealth status, and update the parameters using new data and revised estimation procedures.  We use that model to examine the effects of exogenous changes in M farm commodity prices, and hence in retail prices of N food products, on per capita quantities demanded by each group of consumers.  We translate those changes in per capita demanded of the various food products into measures of healthy eating (the Healthy Eating Index), obesity (BMI and its social cost), and consumer welfare (compensating variation).  The exogenous changes in prices we consider are specified to represent both (1) recent past changes in U.S. farm commodity prices associated with specific causes, and (2) alternative scenarios for future global farm commodity markets reflecting alternative projections of climate change or projections of farm productivity growth, relative to a baseline for specific future years.  An overview of the study and preliminary results will be presented at the workshop.

**Presentation Title:** Perspectives on High Retail Food Prices during 2020-2022

**Abstract:** The recent food price inflation has sparked lively debates globally in media accounts, policy circles, and academics. A large body of literature has emerged across several fields of economics. However, each study typically focuses on a single or subset of causes, indicating that factors contributing to the recent food price inflation are broadly ranging and complex. This paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of what we learned about the major causes of high food prices in 2020-2022 in the United States and how they differ from those identified in prior food price hikes during the Great Recession of 2008. To provide context, we first discuss stylized facts about the U.S. food industry structure and previous empirical evidence on economy-wide drivers of high food prices. We then survey the literature on drivers of food price surges observed since 2020. We document that price surges in 2020-2022 have some unique factors primarily stemming from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic—specifically, U.S. fiscal support and money supply growth are the leading causes. Like in 2008, high oil prices were not a major factor; while high commodity prices might have affected recent food price hikes, it was not found to be one of the primary factors as in 2008. Inflation expectations due to high oil prices, which played a significant role in 2008, were also not found to be an essential cause. Furthermore, the evidence on the role of factors directly related to retailers’ conduct, such as seller’s inflation or price gouging, is mixed. Considering our synthesis, we identify policy priorities and gaps where future research is needed.

**Presentation Title:** Using Panel Data on the Everyday Purchases of 150,000 Representative US Households to Measure Consumer Behavior in Real-Time

**Abstract:** Numerator collects purchase data from receipts, emails, and linked loyalty accounts from a static panel of 150,000 representative US households. This data is available for free for academic use to researchers affiliated with US universities. Using this data, Numerator can track the US Census Bureau's Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services report. Whereas the US Census report is top-down (based on surveying retailers about their revenues), Numerator's analysis is bottom-up (based on receipts and purchase data from verified consumers). This difference allows Numerator to segment changes in retail sales by consumer demographics, looking at the behaviors of low, middle, and high-income consumers, by race/ethnicity, by generation/cohort, and by region of the country. This difference also allows Numerator to look within retailers to see what consumers are buying (e.g., essentials vs. discretionary purchases, brand name vs. private label items). This session will also cover additional topics that researchers may be interested in when using Numerator data, for example, tracking the purchases of SNAP/WIC recipients as SNAP/WIC benefits change and tracking how consumers adjust to food inflation.

**Presentation Title:** Research and development of food price forecasting—optimal selection of leading indicators

**Abstract:** The advent of COVID-19 ended an era of stable US retail food prices that followed the world food price crisis of 2010–2012. Pandemic-related disruptions, avian influenza outbreaks, and the Russia-Ukraine war drove 2022 food-at-home inflation to its highest rate since 1974 (11.4%). In 2023, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) economists responded to these changes by updating food price forecasts with statistical learning protocols to select time-series models and prediction intervals to convey their uncertainty. We characterize the public good provided by these “adaptive” inflation forecasts and enhance them by continuously selecting exogenous variables, improving their precision and explanatory power. The all-items-less-food-and-energy (“core”) index helps predict food prices until 2017; then, the money supply, wholesale-food prices, and food service wages help generate optimal forecasts. The strong relationships between food prices and other prices and the money supply indicate the sensitivity of food markets to macroeconomic forces and government policy choices.

**Presentation Title:** The landscape and challenges of nationally representative forecasting

**Abstract:** The federal government provides many publicly available and internal forecasts and projections, which aid diverse stakeholders. The USDA - Economic Research Service economists contribute specialized expertise on future economic conditions along the food supply chain. These include the farm economy, production, storage, intermediate markets for agricultural inputs, trade and transportation, and retail food markets. The forecasted systems' complexity and overlap with other USDA agency missions motivate interagency collaboration, notably with the Office of the Chief Economist. The diversity of objectives, available data, and audiences have historically encumbered standardization. However, advancements in statistical methods, operational practices, and computation resources provide opportunities for harmonization to the extent possible. This presentation introduces leaders from government, academia, and industry in identifying and implementing best practices to enhance the accuracy and informativeness of forecasts and projections.

**Presentation Title:** Tailoring retail food price forecasts to specific markets: lessons from U.S. seafood

**Abstract:** Retail food price forecasts inform expectations and budgeting for stakeholders, including Federal nutritional assistance programs, consumer groups, and industry. We focus on the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) “fish and seafood” price forecast. Following USDA’s current practices, we use a time series seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) modeling approach with model selection to determine how seafood forecasts can be improved using more refined retail price series. We find substantial reductions in expected SARIMA forecast error of up to 51% and 31% as measured by mean absolute error when disaggregating by product form and species, respectively, suggesting that the aggregate “fish and seafood” forecast does not appropriately proxy for more refined product prices. We then allow for the inclusion of exogenous price determinants in a SARIMAX model framework and compare forecast performance to the SARIMA approach for different types of seafood. Preliminary results suggest that models that minimize information loss include exogenous price determinants, that the selected covariates differ by species and product form, and that a SARIMAX approach can reduce forecast error.

**Presentation Title:** Food-at-Home Monthly Area Prices: Validating price indexes constructed from retail scanner data

**Abstract:** The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) developed the Food-at-Home Monthly Area Prices (F-MAP) data product to provide detailed U.S. food price data for economic research and analysis of food prices, consumer purchasing patterns, and the food environment. F-MAP provides monthly food price data over time, across food groupings, and across geographic areas and includes monthly prices for 90 food-at-home (FAH) categories across 15 geographic areas of the United States. These data are constructed using retail scanner data, which offer extensive and detailed data on spatial and temporal food price variation but are collected from a nonprobability sample of retailers. To understand how prices reported by stores in the retail scanner data compare to established sources of retail price data, we benchmark the F-MAP to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for major food categories and regions. We find strong correlation between the CPI and the scanner data-based price index for all food at home across all geographies but find heterogeneity in the correlations across regions and food categories.
