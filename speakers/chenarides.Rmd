**Presentation Title:** Price Gouging During the Pandemic: Evidence from Scanner Data

**Abstract:** This paper examines the dynamics of retail food pricing during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the two-year period from December 2019 through December 2021. Using a unique dataset capturing item-level wholesale and retail prices, we apply an event-study approach to investigate the impact of state-of-emergency declarations that activated price-gouging regulations on retail markups. Our findings contribute to the understanding of market behavior in the face of supply and demand shocks.
