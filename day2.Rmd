## What to Expect

We will remain in the breakout groups for the next 50 minutes. The structure of the breakout room is as follows:

| Activity   | Time Allotted        |
|--------|----------------|
| Introductions  |    5 minutes   | 
| Activity #1   |   15 minutes     | 
| Activity #2    |  22 minutes      | 
| Reflection Questions   |  8 minutes   | 



## Introductions 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Total Time: 5 minutes**</span>

Welcome, everyone! Let's start off with a quick icebreaker. 

Please introduce yourself by sharing:

- Your name.

- The institution or organization you're affiliated with.

- Think of a paper you're currently working on. Share the dataset you're using and how you're accessing it.


## Activity #1 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Total Time: 15 minutes**</span>

In today’s rapidly evolving research landscape, the ability to quickly and effectively find relevant datasets can be the difference between publishing in a top field journal or spending months finding the right publication home; securing funding for that highly competitive research grant or not; and spending hours instead of days searching for the right dataset for your research project. 

We recognize the challenges associated with sorting through vast amounts of available datasets. Initiatives, like the one being featured today (DemocratizingData.ai), are being developed to simplify components of this process. These efforts require contributions from the community, which is why we have convened this workshop.

This first activity aims to explore these opportunities by conceptualizing an ideal tool for tracking dataset usage statistics. Understanding these statistics informs the public about the relevance and impact of various datasets, and provides information to researchers about the most widely-used (and under-utilized) resources for their work. 


### Thought Experiment

To conceptualize this ideal tool, we will go through a role-playing scenario.

**Scenario:** Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.

**Objective:** We will walk through a series of questions to understand your decision-making process in determining the usefulness of this dataset to you.

**Instructions:** For answering the questions, we'll use Idea Boards, an online collaboration tool that allows participants to share their thoughts and insights through sticky notes. 

*Short tutorial on how to use an Idea Board.*

When instructed, please navigate to your group's Idea Board:

| Breakout Group   | Discussant  | Link to Idea Board | 
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Group 1  | Allie Bauman | [Idea Board 1](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%201/5295004){target="_blank"}         | 
| Group 2  | Rebecca Cleary | [Idea Board 2](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%202/5295006){target="_blank"}         | 
| Group 3  | Alessandro Bonanno | [Idea Board 3](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%203/5295007){target="_blank"}         | 
| Group 4  | Lauren Chenarides | [Idea Board 4](https://ideaboardz.com/for/Group%204/5295009){target="_blank"}         | 

#### A short guide on how to use Idea Boards:

- Navigate to the provided link to access our group’s Idea Board.

- Once there, you’ll find different columns, each corresponding to a specific question or part of our discussion.

- To add your input, click on the ‘Add Sticky’ button (the green plus sign) in the column where you want to post your sticky note.

- You will see a new sticky note appear - start typing your comment.

- Feel free to move your notes around, edit them as the discussion evolves, or "up vote" sticky notes written by others in your group.


### Questions

**Scenario:** Assume you have become aware of a new (to you) dataset and you want to understand whether it is useful for your research and how others have used it.

1. What key pieces of information would you want to know about the usage of this dataset?

    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Pieces of Information" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes

2. Are there tools / resources that can provide you with the information you want?  

    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Tools / Resources" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes

3. What features does, or should, a tool / resource have to help you decide if the dataset is useful? 

    - Add your responses as sticky notes to the "Features" Idea Board. 
    - Time: 3 minutes

## Activity #2 

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Total Time: 30 minutes**</span>

For the next activity, we will walk you through a prototype dashboard that provides data usage information about USDA datasets. ([Access the dashboard here.](https://democratizingdata.ai/agencies/usda-landing/usda-pubs/){target="_blank"})

The primary functions of the dashboard include:

- Identifying users of USDA-produced datasets by region, institution, and field

- Providing information on publications and citations featuring USDA-produced datasets

### Dashboard Walkthrough

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">**Time: 7 minutes**</span>

Let's walk through the dashboard using an example dataset: **Farm to School Census**. This will help everyone familiarize themselves with the dashboard and the types of questions we will be exploring. Please note that there are many features of this dashboard, so the purpose of this tutorial is to give you a framework of how to use the tool. You will have the opportunity to explore this dashboard in greater depth on your own.

5. Consider a feature that has direct links to research articles using the suggested datasets.
   - How valuable would this feature be in making your decision?
   - In what ways could this information offer insights?
   - Would knowing this answer influence your choice of dataset?
   
### Reflect on Your Current Process

1. **Identify Your Needs**
   - Reflect on the last time you were in search of data for your research. What were the key pieces of information you were trying to find?
   - Modality: List - white board with sticky notes (on your own)
   - Time Limit: 
   

2. **Understand Your Motivations**
   - Why were you searching for this data? 
   - What questions were you asking yourself during this process?
   - Modality: Discussion (while looking at the list)
   - Time Limit: 
   
   Examples:
     - Were you looking to see how others have used the dataset?
     - Were you curious about the publications or researchers associated with the dataset?

### Envisioning the Ideal Tool

3. **Time-Saving Features**
   - Given the piece of information in question #1, what feature would save you time or enhance your search to find the ideal dataset? 
   - How would this features change your research process?
   - Modality: Board that is discussion-based
   - Time Limit: *how do we get at this quickly while brainstorming?*

4. **Broadening Your Research Network**
   - Consider how a tool that identifies data experts and institutions involved in similar research areas could impact your work. 
   - Would this facilitate collaboration? 
   - Would it offer new insights?
   - Modality: Poll

5. **Access to Publications**
   - How valuable would it be to have direct links to research articles using specific USDA datasets? 
   - Would this influence your choice of datasets?
   - Modality: Poll
   

Through this first activity, we will delve into how such a tool could transform your research workflows, enhance collaboration opportunities, and significantly improve research outcomes.

***Imagine a tool that could instantly reveal the datasets, researchers, institutions, and focus areas behind the publications driving your research. How much time could you save, and how could this change the way you approach your research?***
As we begin this thought experiment, consider yourself not just as a user, but as a key contributor whose insights could significantly influence the development of this dashboard.
